# Sudoku-Solver-and-Generator
A Sudoku solver and generator written using JavaScript and Canvas
See it in action at https://cs.mcgill.ca/~ysarto/projectsDir/sudoku
## Goals
My father told me to make this to impress my grand-parents, since they are both quite fond Sudoku. My goals with this project were as follows:
- again, further using MVC
- this was my first implementation of a back-track algorithm
- practicing my problem solving skills in terms of algorithms
## On what can be improved
The following below are organized in increasing order of difficulty/feasability
- ~~adding a hint button~~ (*implemented*)
- caching example boards for quicker generation and creating them in the background
- using a faster solver algorithm to improve generation speeds (also prevents people from giving mean examples ): )
